    <p class="indexP"><br>This photo was taken at Apple Park, California, Cupertino in 2019. <br>
      I was very happy under the sunshine.
      This photo recalls the moment when I decided to become a UX Designer.<br>
      The photo was taken when I visited San Francisco as one of the 10 representatives of Sungkyunkwan University when I was a senior.<br>
      We visited IT companies and universities including Google, Stanford  and met UX designers and engineers.
      <br>I am planning to move to California after my Master's degree.

    <h1>Why I like to take pictures?</h1>
    
    <p class="indexP">  
    <br> It is because I was able to cherish more moments when I started to take pictures.
    <br> Fortunately, I had many chances to visit many different areas since I was young.
    <br> I could experience a lot many different food and places which enabled me to be open minded and value diversity.
    <br> Through taking pictures, I can keep the moments and recall them whenver I want.
      </p>
    <h1>Photojournalism</h1>

    <p class="indexP">As I mentioned in the home section, I learned photojournalism in Singapore. As I worked as a journalist in Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea when I was studying there, the photo skills and the responsibility as a photojournalist helped me a lot as I came back to Korea.</p>

    <h1>The Sungkyun Times</h1>

    <p class="indexP">From 2015-2017, at Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea, I was a journalist who writes article for the university. I was lucky to interview many students and professors from the university and also many insightful people in the society. I also took the photos for my articles by myself.
