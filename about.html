    <p>Why I like to take pictures?
    <br> It is because I was able to cherish more moments when I started to take pictures.
    <br> Fortunately, I had many chances to visit many different areas since I was young.
    <br> I could experience a lot many different food and places which enabled me to be open minded and value diversity.
    <br> Through taking pictures, I can keep the moments and recall them whenver I want.

    <h1>Photojournalism</h1>

    <p>As I mentioned in the home section, I learned photojournalism in Singapore. As I worked as a journalist in Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea when I was studying there, the photo skills and the responsibility as a photojournalist helped me a lot as I came back to Korea.</p>
<br>
    <h1>The Sungkyun Times</h1>

    <p>From 2015-2017, at Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea, I was a journalist who writes article for the university. I was lucky to interview many students and professors from the university and also many insightful people in the society. I also took the photos for my articles by myself.
