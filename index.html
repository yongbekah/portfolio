    <h1 id="main">Welcome  &#128075; </h1>

    <p>Hello everyone!<br>
      Iâ€™m Rebekah Lim and Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student at the University of Michigan.<br>
      I was born in Topeka, Kansas (Yes, The Wizard of OzðŸ”®) and moved to Seoul, South Korea when I was 7 years old.
      <br><br>
      Moving a lot in my childhood, introducing myself and meeting new people trained me to be a story-teller with photos.
      <br>
      As a passionate photographer, you can easily spot me taking pictures with Sony a5100 and iPhone 12 Pro.
      <br>
      Always love to learn new things getting my hands dirty.
      <br>
      Shoot me an e-mail to say anything to start a convo. ðŸ“­

    </p>

      <h1>Photos</h1>
      <p>For me, photos are really precious. I love to take them and they are the records of my life. When I started to take pictures? I can't really reacall, however, I remember the moment when I was in a family trip, father let me learn how to take a picture with the digital camera that he chrished the most. Since that, I never forget to think about the angle when I take a photo. If you want a photoshoot, let me know!<br>
    </p>

    <h1>More</h1>
    <p class="indexP">In addition, with the passion of photo and jounalism, I did a Summer exchange semester at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore learnging different skills of photography and the meaning and impact of photojournalism. <br>
      What I learned from the course changed my mindset of taking pictures. Now, I take pictures not to only caputure good moments, but to capture the genuine moments of life.
